## About

This repository implements a small decentralized exchange and token platform on Stellar using Soroban smart contracts. It includes:

- Smart contracts (Rust) for tokens, a token factory, and a DEX located under `contracts/`.
- A React frontend (Vite) to interact with the contracts under `frontend/`.
- Helper scripts for building, deploying and testing the contracts in `scripts/`.
